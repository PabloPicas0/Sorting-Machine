# Sorting Visualizer
Sort Visualizer shows working of classic sorting algorithms 
such as merge sort, selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort.

This app was build using React and can be accessed here: https://pablopicas0.github.io/Sorting-Machine/ 

## Motivation
I wanted to further improve my skills with React and also learn some basic sorting algorithms.
This project gave me a lot of fun and also was a great way to achieve aforementioned objectives.
